## 📝 Usage Example

```
My Vault/
├── Characters/
│   ├── Player 1.md          → Page "Player 1"
│   └── NPCs/
│       └── Goblin.md        → Page "Goblin" in category "NPCs"
├── Locations/
│   └── Tavern.md            → Page "Tavern"
└── Sessions/
    └── Session 1.md         → Page "Session 1"
```

Exported as:
```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Characters",
      "items": [
        { "type": "page", "name": "Player 1", "htmlContent": "..." },
        {
          "type": "category",
          "name": "NPCs",
          "items": [
            { "type": "page", "name": "Goblin", "htmlContent": "..." }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Locations",
      "items": [
        { "type": "page", "name": "Tavern", "htmlContent": "..." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Sessions",
      "items": [
        { "type": "page", "name": "Session 1", "htmlContent": "..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 Features

### Wiki Links (Mentions)

Obsidian wiki links are automatically converted to clickable mentions:

```markdown
The character [[Player 1]] visited [[Tavern]].
```

They become mentions that navigate between pages in GM Vault, just like Notion mentions.

### Tags

Tags are converted to colored Notion-style badges:

```markdown
tags: #character, #npc, #location
```

Each tag gets a consistent color based on its name, matching GM Vault's Notion-style UI.

### Full Markdown Support

- **Bold**: `**text**` → `<strong>text</strong>`
- **Italic**: `*text*` → `<em>text</em>`
- **Lists**: Rendered with Notion styles
- **Tables**: Rendered with Notion styles
- **Code**: Rendered with Notion styles
- **External links**: Open in new tab

## 🔒 Security and Privacy

- ✅ **100% local**: All processing happens on your machine
- ✅ **No servers**: No internet connection required
- ✅ **No shared data**: JSON is generated locally
- ✅ **Full control**: You decide when to export and what to share

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No session folder selected"

1. Run the "Select session folder" command
2. Select the folder that contains your notes

### Images don't appear

- Local images are omitted by design
- Use external URLs to include images: `![alt](https://example.com/image.png)`
- Or upload images to a hosting service (Imgur, Cloudinary, etc.)

### Mentions don't work

- Make sure file names match the wiki links
- Wiki links are case-insensitive: `[[Player 1]]` and `[[player 1]]` work the same

### Import error in GM Vault

- Verify the JSON file was generated correctly
- Check the GM Vault console for error messages
- Ensure the JSON structure matches GM Vault's expected format

## 📝 Notes

- The plugin **does not modify** your Obsidian notes
- It's **read-only** (you can't edit from GM Vault)
- Changes in Obsidian require **re-exporting** the vault
- The JSON file is overwritten each time you export
