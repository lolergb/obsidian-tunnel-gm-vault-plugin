## 📘 **Cinematic summary (DM only)**
The PCs reach the **mountain pass** with a **column of fleeing civilians**.  
The enemy advances behind them, led by a **minor officer** in the Dragon Queen's service.

This fight is not about victory.  
It is about **buying time**.

Every round held allows more people to cross.  
Every rash choice costs blood.

## ⏱️ **Climax Clock (core mechanic)**
Every **2 rounds**:
- One group of civilians crosses **if the PCs hold**.  
- If the enemy advances unchecked, **civilians are endangered**.

After **6–8 rounds**, the objective is complete.  
The fight ends when the **clock fills**, not when enemies fall.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — The enemy leader**
> The officer steps forward.  
> His armor is scarred, not ornate.  
> He raises a hand — and the advance aligns instantly.  
> When he looks at you, there is no hatred.  
> Only recognition.  
> "You are not the objective," he says.  
> "But you will not step aside."
