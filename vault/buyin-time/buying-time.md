## 🎯 One-sentence pitch
> After leaving the Twilight Forest, Cardo and Romero reach an apparently insignificant rural crossing, unaware that it will be the first place where they must decide **who lives long enough to flee** as the shadow of the Dragon Queen begins to close the road.

> *Buying Time* takes place along the eastern backroads of Abanasinia, between liminal forests and the approaches to the Vingaard Valley, in the days immediately preceding the visible outbreak of the War of the Lance.

# 🧭 OVERALL NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

## Node 1 — Omen / Choice — [[E1-The-Watched-Crossing|The Watched Crossing]]
Cardo and Romero reach a rural crossing where civilians can still flee… or continue onward.  
An enemy vanguard observes without attacking.  
Here it is decided **who will be in danger next**.

## Node 2 — Violence / Cost — [[E2-The-Burning-Farm|The Burning Farm]]
The attack has already begun.  
Fire, smoke, and screams.  
Saving people costs information.  
Chasing the enemy costs lives.

## Node 3 — Revelation / Scale — [[E3-The-Forest-Cementery|The Forest Cemetery]] 
A desecrated place reveals the threat is neither local nor recent.  
This is not a raid.  
It is a rehearsal.  
Here it becomes clear that fleeing only buys time.

## Node 4 — Climax / Sacrifice — [[E4-The-Mountain-Pass|The Mountain Pass]]
Civilians cross while the enemy advances.  
Terrain matters as much as steel.  
This is not about winning, but about **holding long enough**.

## Epilogue — Consequence — [[Epilogue-What-Was-Saved|What Was Saved]] 
A safe place, paid for dearly.  
No one celebrates.  
But someone lives to remember.

## **Flow: Linear with accumulated consequences**  
- Macro structure: Crossing → Farm → Cemetery → Pass → Epilogue  
- Micro structure: each decision worsens or eases the next node

# 🎭 HOOKS & MOTIVATIONS

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Emotional | The PCs come from surviving. Here they must **choose others**. |
| Moral | There are no clean choices. Every action saves something and condemns something else. |
| Personal | Romero feels draconic echoes; Cardo senses the forest's unrest. |
| Human | Civilians with names, fear, and urgency. Not background scenery. |
| Tragic | "We didn't arrive late… we arrived when choosing still hurts." |
| PC Bond | They shift from survivors to **reluctant protectors**. |
