## 📘 **Cinematic summary (DM only)**
The PCs emerge from the forest after the events of *The Twilight Edge* and reach a **rural crossing** connecting several local routes.  
There is no combat, no shouting, no flight… but **something is watching**.

The crossing acts as a **human node**: civilians can still divert, flee, or continue without knowing what lies ahead.  
A **discreet enemy vanguard** controls the flow without overt violence.

This encounter establishes:
- the **first contact with an organized threat**,  
- early **moral responsibility**,  
- who will be endangered in the next encounter,  
- whether the enemy remembers the PCs.

## 👣 **How do they arrive?**
- They leave the forest via a secondary path.  
- The crossing opens ahead with **multiple viable roads**.  
- Normal human movement, but **no idle conversation**.  
- Romero senses an unease, as if someone were counting steps.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — Arrival**
> The path widens, and suddenly the forest loosens its grip.  
> The crossing opens before you like an old wound no one ever closed.  
> Roads split, but none promise safety.  
> Dust lingers in the air a moment too long,  
> as if even the wind hesitates before moving on.

## 👂 **As they approach**
- Wagon wheels on dry gravel.  
- A farmer pauses at the sight of the PCs… then moves on without greeting.  
- Two figures leaning near the road watch with unsettling focus.  
- Wind drags dust and dead leaves toward the center of the crossing.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — Being watched**
> There is an unease you cannot quite name.  
> Not fear.  
> The certainty that someone **was here before you**…  
> and never left.  
> A gaze held a moment too long.  
> A gesture stopped halfway.  
> Someone grips a cart handle, then lets go,  
> as if remembering it won't help.
