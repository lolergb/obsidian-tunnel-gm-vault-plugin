## 📘 **Cinematic summary (DM only)**
Following fresh tracks from the farm, the PCs reach an **old, secluded cemetery** — forgotten and **desecrated**.

This is not a mandatory combat encounter.  
It is a place of **truth**: the threat is not local, improvised, or recent.  
It serves something greater.

This encounter establishes:
- the **true nature of the enemy**,  
- the link to the **Dragon Queen** (not yet named aloud),  
- that fleeing only **buys time**, not safety.

## 📋 **GM direction notes**
- Slow the pace after E2's chaos.  
- Allow real silence at the table.  
- Do not force combat; if it happens, keep it brief and tense.  
- The cemetery should feel **respected — and violated**.

## 📊 **Technical balance**
| CR | XP | Type | Notes |
|----|----|------|------|
| Low | Low | Exploration + Revelation | Optional combat |

## 👣 **How do they arrive?**
- They follow tracks into the forest.  
- Ambient sounds fade away.  
- The air grows colder and still.  
- Romero feels a familiar pressure in his chest, like a memory not his own.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — Entering the clearing**
> The forest opens without warning.  
> Not like a path… but like a concession.  
> Ancient trees ring a circular clearing.  
> At its center, crooked headstones rise from damp earth,  
> some split, others torn free.  
> No birds.  
> No insects.  
> This is not a forgotten place.  
> It is a place **people stopped visiting on purpose**.

## 👀 **What's on the map**
- **Ancient headstones**, many unreadable.  
- **Recently disturbed earth**.  
- **Strange symbols**, carved or traced in ash.  
- Remains that **do not match human burial**.

## 🎯 **Encounter objectives**
- **Discover** the enemy's true nature.  
- **Understand** this is part of something larger.  
- **Decide** what to do with the knowledge.  
- Prepare emotionally for the **climax**.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — Desecration**
> A headstone has been torn from the ground.  
> Beneath it, the soil is disturbed… but not looted.  
> No one was looking for treasure.  
> They were looking for **something specific**.  
> Among the remains are fragments that do not belong to any human body.  
> Bone, yes…  
> but worked in an unnatural way.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — The truth**
> This was not a raid.  
> It was not looting.  
> It was a **minor ritual**, a test.  
> As if someone were preparing the ground…  
> or counting the dead.  
> Nothing began here.  
> Someone merely confirmed it could begin.
