## 📘 **Cinematic summary (DM only)**
The PCs reach the **farm** after the attack has **already begun**.  
There is no time to plan or assess calmly: fire, smoke, and screams dictate the pace.

The enemy force acts with **cold discipline**.  
They do not raid for pleasure — they are **executing orders**.

This encounter establishes:
- that the threat is **organized**, not chaotic,  
- that saving everyone is **impossible**,  
- that every action has an immediate cost.

## 📋 **GM direction notes**
- Keep the pace high; cut long conversations.  
- Always describe **two problems at once**.  
- Fire spreads even when ignored.  
- The enemy **withdraws once objectives are met**.

## 📊 **Technical balance**
| CR | XP | Type | Notes |
|----|----|------|------|
| Variable | Variable | Combat + Rescue | Civilians shape difficulty |

## 👣 **How do they arrive?**
- They see the glow of fire **before hearing the screams**.  
- Smoke rises in uneven columns.  
- Animals flee without direction.  
- If civilians were diverted in E1, fewer are trapped; otherwise, chaos increases.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — Arrival**
> The smell arrives first.  
> Burning wood. Straw. Animal fat.  
> Then the sound:  
> a scream cut short,  
> the dry crack of a collapsing beam,  
> a horse's desperate whinny.  
> The farm is burning.  
> And it did not start a moment ago.

## 👀 **What's on the map**
- **Main house**: partially ablaze.  
- **Stable**: animals trapped.  
- **Fences**: broken in several places.  
- **Civilians**: 2–5 (depending on E1), scattered and disoriented.  
- **Attackers**: organized, limited in number.

## 🎯 **Encounter objectives**
- **Save as many lives as possible**.  
- **Contain or drive off** the attackers.  
- **Choose priorities under pressure**.  
- Decide between **rescue or pursuit**.

## 📖 **Read-Aloud — Chaos**
> A woman drags a wounded man away from the stable.  
> A child cries from a window blackened with smoke.  
> Through the fire, armed figures move with unsettling calm,  
> as if this were not their first burning farm.
